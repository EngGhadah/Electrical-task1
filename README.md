# Electrical-task1
Here is a simplified algorithm to control servo motors for a robot's walking motion. This algorithm assumes a bipedal robot with two legs, each having a hip and knee servo motor. 
Walking Algorithm.
```python
# Define the servo motor positions for different parts of the walk cycle
def set_servo_positions(hip_left, knee_left, hip_right, knee_right):
# Set the servo positions using a servo control library or API
servo_hip_left.write(hip_left)
servo_knee_left.write(knee_left)
servo_hip_right.write(hip_right)
servo_knee_right.write(knee_right)
# Define the walking cycle positions (angles in degrees)
# These positions are examples and may need to be adjusted for your specific robot
walk_cycle = [
{"hip_left": 30, "knee_left": 60, "hip_right": -30, "knee_right": 60}, # Left leg forward, right leg back
{"hip_left": 0, "knee_left": 45, "hip_right": 0, "knee_right": 45}, # Both legs straight
{"hip_left": -30, "knee_left": 60, "hip_right": 30, "knee_right": 60}, # Right leg forward, left leg back
{"hip_left": 0, "knee_left": 45, "hip_right": 0, "knee_right": 45} # Both legs straight
]
# Walking function
def walk():
while True: # Loop to continuously walk
for position in walk_cycle:
set_servo_positions(position["hip_left"], position["knee_left"], position["hip_right"], position["knee_right"])
time.sleep(0.5) # Adjust the sleep time to control the speed of the walk cycle
# Import necessary libraries
import time
import some_servo_library as servo
# Initialize the servos (this will be specific to your hardware)
servo_hip_left = servo.Servo(1) # Example servo initialization
servo_knee_left = servo.Servo(2)
servo_hip_right = servo.Servo(3)
servo_knee_right = servo.Servo(4)
# Start walking
walk()
```
 Explanation:
1. **Servo Position Function**: `set_servo_positions()` sets the positions of the hip and knee servos for both legs.
2. **Walk Cycle**: `walk_cycle` defines a sequence of positions representing different stages of the walking motion.
3. **Walk Function**: The `walk()` function iterates through the walk cycle positions, setting the servos to each position and pausing briefly to simulate walking.
 Notes:
- The angles for the servos (`hip_left`, `knee_left`, `hip_right`, `knee_right`) are examples and should be adjusted based on the physical capabilities and geometry of your robot.
- The `time.sleep(0.5)` function call controls the speed of the walk. Adjust this value to make the robot walk faster or slower.
- Replace `some_servo_library` with the actual servo control library you are using.
- Ensure that the servos are properly initialized and calibrated according to your specific hardware requirements.
This algorithm provides a basic structure for walking motion and can be further refined for smoother and more complex movements.
